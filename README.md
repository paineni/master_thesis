# Enhancing Object Detection in Large Images through Efficient Processing and Evaluation

## 1. Research Area or Field: 
Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Object Detection.

## 2. Research Problem or Question: 
When applying neural networks to remote sensing or quality control tasks, it's essential to consider the trade-offs between image resolution, computational resources, and the level of detail required for the task at hand. Image preprocessing techniques, such as image resizing and cropping, are often used to adapt images to the network's input size while preserving critical information. In light of these considerations, the central research question is: "How can we improve object detection in large images while optimizing hardware usage, processing time, and model performance?"

## 3. Purpose and Significance: 
This research is significant because it tackles a crucial issue in computer vision applications dealing with large photos. It aims to enhance the accuracy of object detection while considering the practical constraints of hardware limitations and processing efficiency. The outcomes of this study can lead to more effective object detection techniques for a range of applications, especially in remote sensing, where the trade-offs between image resolution and computational resources are particularly relevant.

## 4. Scope and Limitations:
The research will focus on comparing different methods for handling large images, such as downscaling and tiling, on a dataset selected by the thesis author. The evaluation will consider factors like memory consumption, processing time, model performance, and other potential challenges related to the used method. 

## 5. Methodology:
The proposed methodology involves a comparative analysis of different techniques for object detection in large images. 

## 6. Expected Outcomes:
The expected outcomes include insights into the trade-offs between different object detection approaches in terms of memory consumption, processing time, and accuracy. Additionally, the discover object detection frameworks that offer built-in solutions for training models on large images effectively.
